# Image-Caption-Generation

Overview
An Image Caption Generator is an advanced AI system that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to automatically generate textual descriptions for images. Using deep learning models, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) or LSTM for language modeling, the generator analyzes the content of an image and produces descriptive sentences that describe its key elements and context. This technology finds applications in aiding visually impaired individuals, automating content tagging in media libraries, enhancing search engine capabilities by enabling image-based queries, and enriching user experiences on social media platforms by automatically captioning uploaded images.

## Table of Contents
#### Getting Started
Make sure you have the foloowing installed on your system-

- python 
- loblib == 1.3.2
- numpy == 1.24.2
- pandas == 2.0.2
- scikit-learn == 1.3.2
- streamlit == 1.28.0
- xgboost == 2.0.1

You can also get this libraries in requirements.txt

####. Data Collection
- You can get the data set in any online site. I mostly prefered Kaggle.

#### Data Preprocessing
- Checking missing values
- Handle null values
- Preparing the data Prediction
- removing outliers
- Handle inappropiate data types

####  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Plotting some sort of graphs and charts to get a short Overview of the data.

#### Feature Engineering
- In this step we are manage all the categorical column before puting the data int the model.
- Encoding the categorical Variables

#### Model Training
- Splitting the dataset into test data and train data
- Importing the model
- Fiting the data into model
- Testing the Prediction
7. Model Evaluation
- Checking the accuracy of the model in comparison various ML  algorithms.

#### Save the Model  
- Saving the model for deployment
- Saving the model in JSON fdromat for deployment on streamlit
## Deployment
The Deployment phase is cricial. To complete this phase follow following steps-
- Create app.py or main.py
  This the file which consist of the GUI of our model
- Put given three files into one folder
  - Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb
  - main.py
  - xgb_model.json
  - require2.txt or requirement.txt
- Now go to the same folder and open command prompt into it. Now run the following command
  ###### streamlit run main.py
  
  - Then enter your email

  - After entering your email you will be redirected to the interface of your application. But in some case if you are not redirected to the browser or your application interface try to put local URL or Networl URL into search bar.

 #### Now your interface will look like this-
